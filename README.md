Generative AI and ChatGPT - Quickstart with Examples, by Packt Publishing

This course delves deep into the OpenAI API, gaining expertise in NLP and code generation. Learn to leverage the Completions endpoint, optimize prompt design, and understand token usage. With hands-on projects such as fact-based search, image generation, and code completion, we will acquire practical skills and use Node.js, React.js, and Next.js to build cutting-edge applications.

This comprehensive course begins with an introduction to the OpenAI API and a deep understanding of its NL and code processing capabilities. We will explore the Completions endpoint and tackle various NLP tasks such as content generation, summarization, semantic search, and sentiment analysis. We will discover the different models available, including the cutting-edge GPT-3 model, and learn to apply them to solve unique use cases. We will master the art of prompt design and settings to optimize API output and control generated text.

We will acquire a comprehensive understanding of tokens and their role in controlling API response. We will engage in hands-on projects, build apps like a fact-based search, and generate images using DALL-E.
With a focus on cutting-edge tech stacks such as Node JS, ReactJS, and NextJS, you will be equipped to build advanced apps. Upon completion, you will have the skills to leverage OpenAI API and revolutionize NLP and code generation abilities.
